(Perhaps\nwe can arrange a special purchase of just the cover if demand\nwarrants.)</p>\n<p>You will also need to purchase or have the Keypad PCB fabricated.  The\nKiCad design files are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/cscott/OpenEVSE_Keypad_RFID/raw/master/Keypad-Front\"><code>Keypad-Front</code></a>\nsubdirectory. It’s a four-layer PCB, and I recommend white silkscreen\nto avoid heating when in direct sun.  I used 1oz copper on a standard\n1.6mm thick PCB.  I found that <a href=\"https://jlcpcb.com/\">JLCPCB</a> had\nvery reasonable prices.</p>\n<p>I assume you also own an\n<a href=\"https://store.openevse.com/collections/all-products\">OpenEVSE Advanced Series</a>\nand have assembled it.</p>\n<p>You will also need an LCD mount, which can be 3d printed.  You <em>might</em>\nbe able to reuse the one from your existing OpenEVSE device, but\nyou’ll need to pry the glue off then cut down the top bar. It’s\nprobably easier just to print a new one.</p>\n<p>TODO: image and STL of LCD mount.</p>\n<p>For compatibility with the latest OpenEVSE web interface, you will\nalso need to update the firmware on your main OpenEVSE controller\nboard.  This is out of scope for this guide, but you can find\ninstructions HERE.  It’s a good thing to do between step 3 and 4\nwhen you have your OpenEVSE charger disconnected and open.</p>"

If you\nhave the latest-generation WiFi board, this will be a STEMMA-QT cable\n(JST-SH, with 1.0mm pitch).  Older boards had an 8-pin JST-PH\nconnector (2.0mm pitch) and you will have to fabricate an adapter\nyourself.</p>\n<p>TODO: photos here</p>"

I found that placing the board inside\nthe cover and then using generous drops of hot glue around the\nscrew bosses secured the Keypad PCB in a reversible manner, so that I\ncould still remove it if I needed to later.</p>\n<p>TODO: photo here</p>\n<p>If you’re braver, a clear contact-sensitive adhesive tape (3M\nmakes a number of different types) would make a more permanent\nbond.  Eliminating the air gap between the front cover and the\nKeypad PCB is said to yield better performance from capacitive touch\nsensors, but the hot-glue method has worked well enough for me.</p>"
